# 3D_object_detection-and-holistic_detection_using_objectron_dataset_and_mediapipe_and_opencv
the project contains two different files one for 3d image detection and second for holistic detection.
The project utilizes OpenCv, Python, MediaPipe API'S for detection.
It is capabel of running on workstation without GPU.
The 3D object detection is only capabel of detecting cup,shoe,camera, and chair as specified in mediapipe API.
The holistic detection detects face mesh ,hands and body postures.
It can detect upto 30+fps.
google objectron dataset trained in mediapipe is making this possible.
